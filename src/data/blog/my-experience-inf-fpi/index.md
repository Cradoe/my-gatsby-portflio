Everyone’s first semester at a higher institution is bound to be different. It’s a major step up from secondary school – bringing new friends, new places, new skills, and new experiences. My experience has been a mix of both positive times and challenges which I had already anticipated before starting.

The experiences thus far have been amazing. I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period, and it has gone by so fast. I am still discovering all the opportunities that higher institution offers me. The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro is a very welcoming place, and from the first day, I felt at home here. I have made many new friends from many different backgrounds.

Outside of school studies, I learn a lot of personal things, enroll in online courses, attend tech events (often sponsored by tech giants like Facebook, Google, Andela, and co), and spend a fair amount of time walking the streets of Ilaro getting familiar with the community.

Time has been flying by and it’s hard to believe that I have been on campus for 4 years already. Life at FPI is a great experience that I plan to make the most out of.
